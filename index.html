            <p id="info-97">
                I have a passion for computer programming and information technology. I have used computer programming since I was in grade school. 
                This passion has given me the ability to develop programs for a multitude of things, including robots and programming languages.
                My other love is information technology. I have many plans to implement newer technologies in my life such as cloud computing and managed IT services.
                <br>
                <br>
                I enjoy solving technical problems, researching and developing new technologies, designing software applications for different platforms.
                I am also interested in pursuing degree programs in Information Systems Management or Computer Science. I enjoy meeting people and working with them in a team environment. 
                I also enjoy interacting with clients and customers. My strong customer service skills allow me to do this well. I am a quick learner with a fun, outgoing personality.
                In addition, I excel in my ability to work under pressure and handle stressful situations very well.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am open to learning new things and getting involved with new projects that can help me learn or apply all that I have learned throughout my Academic career.
